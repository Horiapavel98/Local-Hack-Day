# FinAhead
---

Local Hack Day enabled us to think in detail and develop our idea
for a **finance related application**. We had an amazing time building it
and thrived as a team to win the runner-up prize.

  FinAhead is a finance application that lets the user inspect the prices
  and make correct decisions about his/hers future investments.

Being fully implemented in python using TkInter class for GUI, FinAhead focuses
on both plotting and displaying data. The application queries the 'yahoo' stock exchange
for information.

  In this image below, the normal state of the application can be seen after a user
  has clicked the 'Plot' button.

  Another use case of our application is the 'Show Volatility' button that outputs
  the volatility of the stock market prices of the selected company, its name, the stock
  exchange code for that company and the domain of that company (TECH/FIN/RETAIL).
